Awesome villas--we stayed in the 2-story Alpha which has a balcony with a superlative view, a nice kitchen and dining area, a great bedroom upstairs and living area downstairs. It is like a home away from home in charming Crete. I strongly recommend this B&B for peace and quiet, access to a beautiful beach downhill, and centrality to visit the rest of Crete.

We had room 311 with some peeling wallpaper, but the bathroom looked to been refurbished recently and the shower was exceptionally good.

And at the end I forgot a Tshirt and they don’t answer by phone.  To not forget: the room doesn’t have a key, they pretend they have cameras.   everything was rusty, dirty, unwashed, the scarves were gray when they should have been white.  the kindest people were at the bar and the restaurant.  you can see the reception from the photo 🤔 and the so-called receptionist was more undressed than dressed  we made a payment at the bank knowing the price was 85 euros and when we got there they told us the price per room is 105 euros per room  Please dont go in this place\n",

The view is absolutely breathtaking! We learned in talking to our hosts that they just recently took the property over and are working very hard to create an amazing experience for guests. They still have a little ways to go but are coming from the right place and their kindness and friendliness make up for the small shortcomings they are still working through.  The beds are the most comfortable we slept on in our 3 week tour of Albania! The rooms are decorated in a beautiful modern minimalist style so the star of the show is the view. The individual pools are an awesome touch and when you are sitting in it looking out over the bay it is an incredible experience! The whole property is settled right into the natural\n",

This is a clean hotel with nice rooms, friendly staff and a good breakfast.  But it's cold! It's cold in the bar, it's cold in the bathroom because there's no separate heating. If you want a warm bathroom you have to leave the door to the room open and get the heat from there which is inconvenient for sleeping and probably not very economic.  Probably a better choice in summer but lacks a swimming pool.\n",

It's well situated, and the host is very helpful in suggesting things to do, like walking routes for example. His best advice was to tell me to go to any restaurant in the town centre because they're all good (he was right).   If you are not fit, you should have some means for getting to and from the town centre because it's a 600m steep grade walk back to the villa.   The rooms are fairly basic but clean and well-equipped. They would be ideal for a small family or a group of friends.\n",

At the same time, we saw a baptism that was taking place at the very small church near the restaurant. This is a lovely area away from the coast with a splendid view where the swimming pool is. It was really nice as well to walk around the village and visit the little gift shops and artisan workshops where we learnt a lot about traditional Cretan life in the past. Really well worth our trip.\n"
